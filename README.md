This is a final project on clustering  and classifying small-cell lung cancer based on expression patterns and microenvironment data. The project was performed at a Biohackathon 2023 by Anna Kalygina, Lada Polyakova, Elizaveta Terekhova, and Alina Shtock. Here you can find a pipeline, that involves pre-processing data, clustering dataset, deconvolution, and classifyer.
